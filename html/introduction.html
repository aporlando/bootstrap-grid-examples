        <h1>Responsive Grids with Bootstrap</h1>

        <h3>What's the point?</h3>
        <p>It's important that users are able to use applications across all of their devices, providing a seamless experience. A responsive grid system can help us design these seamless experiences easily, quickly, and in a standard, maintainable way.</p>

        <h3>What do you mean by 'responsive'?</h3>
        <p>When I talk about ‘responsive’, I’m talking about creating application design that is user friendly across all screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Think about all the devices users have today: desktop, laptop, tablets, phablets, phone, wearables. All of in an array of various screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to create a design that can respond to any screen size and provide a good user experience.</p>

        <h3>Who uses Bootstrap anyway?</h3>
        <p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> was developed by Twitter. But it's not just Twitter that uses it - there's a whole bunch of places that use Bootstrap. Bootstrap has <a href="http://expo.getbootstrap.com">a site dedicated to showing off sites that use Bootstrap.</a></p>
        <p>You probably visit sites that use it every day without realizing it. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">Check out this one.</a>.</p>

        <h3>What is a grid system?</h3>
        <p>Generally, a <strong>grid system</strong> is a set of measurements a designer can use to align and size objects within the given format.</p>
        <p>Bootstrap provides its own grid system of rows and columns that we can use to quickly create responsive layouts for all screen sizes.</p>

        <h3>So what's this whole thing about?</h3>
        <p>We're going to be talking about applying Bootstrap classes to HTML containers (in this case <code>div</code>s.) to achieve a desired layout.</p>
        <p>I'm going to jump in by showing you real examples which will move through Bootstrap's rules for their grid system. Then, we'll code a layout together from wireframes.</p>
        <p>It might seem like I'm throwing a lot of information at you, but remember that the information is readily available for reference. Please feel free to stop me at any time for questions,</p>
        <p>I've coded the examples with extra styles that will highlight the different grid parts that we will be using. Purple for containers, light blue for rows, green for columns, and a dark shading for content. I'm not going to linger long on the specific naming of classes, since this is easily accessible from the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap Documentation</a>.</p>
